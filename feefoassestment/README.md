### Setup
This is a Spring maven project set up using Java 13.

The 2 problems have their own main method and their own implementation class.
* Problem1Application to run the first problem
* Problem2Application to run the second problem

If you want to run it you just have to execute without any vm options. The base information is hardcoded, in case it is necessary to add extra information should be added into the main methods. 

### Run the test

You can run the test executing **mvn test** or run the java files under the test folder.
